# Homelands App

# Developer candidate assignment
# Develop an application that allows a user to select a country and display a small amount of information about that country, inlcuding displaying the country's flag.

# The application should make use of the REST countries API (https://restcountries.eu)
# Note: https://restcountries.eu is not available so I used the new REST countries API = https://restcountries.com/v3.1

# For the app name, I thought of a better term for Countries in which I ended up with Homelands since it has a better feel to it.

# Tech Stack Used
# MVVM + Clear Architecture Setup (commons, data, domain, ui)
# Koin Dependency Injection
# Kotlin Flow
# CMake - securing api base url
# View Binding

# I've added a vector header on the homescreen and a custom loading screen to add more life and feel to the app

# Features that should be added in future development (Couldn't add for now)
# - Search Bar
# - Switch from List View to Grid View
# - Animations for List and Flags
